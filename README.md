# Discription - As part of my internship, I worked on the design and implementation of a Home Automation System using Bluetooth technology and Arduino microcontroller. The project aimed to provide a cost-effective and user-friendly solution to control home appliances remotely using a smartphone.

The system allows the user to control devices such as lights, fans, and other electrical appliances via a Bluetooth connection using a custom Android app or serial terminal apps like Bluetooth Terminal. When a command is sent from the mobile device, it is received by the Bluetooth module (HC-05) connected to the Arduino, which then processes the command and triggers the appropriate output to control relays connected to household appliances.
